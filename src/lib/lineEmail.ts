 * Mail a customer the streaming login they just received.

 * The billing API sends nothing at all (docs/billing/API.md: "No email is
 * involved anywhere"), so without this the username and password exist only
 * on the TV screen — gone the moment the viewer walks away or the box is
 * wiped. The edge function verifies the line against the panel before it
 * sends, composes the body itself, and throttles per line and per IP.
 *
 * Every failure here is non-fatal by design: the credentials are already on
 * screen and already saved to the device, so a bounced email must never block
 * someone from watching. Callers surface the message and move on.
